# the solution component

  A cluster that contains 4 docker containers that can be orchestrated and scaled by Kubernetes

  1- Elasticsearch
            is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable
	    full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.
	    I decided to choose it in our case because it contains a ready geo module and can execute queries 
	    on geodata with a super performance. It can search in millions of records in seconds at the same 
	    time it's scalable and can run more than one node. 
          	
  2- Logstash
            is an open-source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously,
	    transforms it, and then sends it to elastic

  3- Kibana
	   is an open-source data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities 
	   on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. It's very helpful for the data visualization

  4- API
	   .net core web API that used as an endpoint to the outer world to use the solution
